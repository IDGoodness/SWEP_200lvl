This code is a Rust program that generates and prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The Fibonacci function takes a u32 parameter n and returns a u32 value. This function calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Inside the Fibonacci function, there are two conditional statements The first conditional statement checks if n is less than or equal to 1. 
If it is, the function immediately returns n as the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. 
This is because the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and all subsequent numbers are the sum of the two preceding ones.

The second conditional statement is a for loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive). Inside the loop, the following steps are performed:

A new variable next is calculated as the sum of prev and curr.
The value of prev is updated to be the current value of curr.
The value of curr is updated to be the new value of next.
This loop continues until n is reached. The final value of curr is returned as the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

The main function is the entry point of the program. It initializes a variable n with a value of 10. This variable represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate and print.

Inside the main function, a for loop is used to iterate from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive). Inside the loop, the Fibonacci function is called with the current value of i as the argument. The result is then printed to the console.

The program ends after printing all the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number.

To generate a different number of Fibonacci numbers, you can change the value of n in the main function.



fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }

    let mut prev = 0;
    let mut curr = 1;

    for _ in 2..=n {
        let next = prev + curr;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }

    curr
}

fn main() {
    let n = 20; // Change this value to generate a different number of Fibonacci numbers

    for i in 0..n {
        println!("Fibonacci({}) = {}", i, fibonacci(i));
    }
}
